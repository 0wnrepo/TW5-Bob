There are many options, I think that an mdns plugin to find nodes on the local
network is going to be the most effective and simplest method.

The mdns plugin is probably going to end up be separate from Bob, it may be
packaged with BobEXE.

For nodes that are off the local network I will use Dodo. I am not sure about
packaging that with Bob.
